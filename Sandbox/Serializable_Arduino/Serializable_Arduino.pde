/*
The purpose of this sandbox is to create a proof of concept where a
Processing application can read in a text file with serialized objects
and then take those objects and turn on led's on an arduino. 

This is the most important aspect of the All Spark Cube 
All other software is just to make these files easy for the user
to create
