All files in this directory are sample code. Each folder is an individual project


Rules of Coding:

- Never write code to the main project until you have tested it in a sandbox and know how it works

- Remember the order of coding Think - Design - Test - Create

- Comment every single line. If in doubt, comment it twice!!

- Program the same way God made the earth  Think - Design - Test - Create 



90 Percent of the world coders use the methodology "Think - Create - Test - Throw away & Start Over"
The correct way taught by the best teachers such as Lee Barney is 

"Think - Design - Test - Create"

Think means : Write down everything the program should do and also what it wont do in this release. 

Design means : Design everything in the UML in this order Use Case > Use Case Documents > Activity Diagrams > Class Diagrams > Sequence Diagrams
		Once the Sequence Diagram is done, the code is effectivly written, It only takes a monkey to enter the keystrokes. 

Test means : Create a happy path, what should happen, then think of everything mallicious that a user could do. pass in negative values, leave 
		things blank, Attempt buffer over runs. Create complete JUnit tests and User Tests. 

Create means : Actually entering the keystrokes to translate the sequence Diagram to the program. This is the fastest step and must, MUST, MUST!!!!
		Be done last !!! This is how to write bullet proof code.
